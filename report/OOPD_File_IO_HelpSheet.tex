    \question{Introduction}
	The following report is to accompany the OOSE Assignment 2016. It will discuss the use of polymorphism, design patterns, testability and plausible alternatives. 
     
    \question{Polymorphism}
     
	Polymorphism has been used in multiple places. 
	
	 \begin{note}
	 	Where have you used polymorphism, and why? Discuss any design patterns youâ€™ve used that incorporate polymorphism. 
	 \end{note}

    \question{Testability}
     
	\textbf{Dependency Injection \\}
	Has been used to assist in testability. Rather than each class having a new instance of a class it needs, an object is passed in instead. 
	 \begin{note}
	 	How does your design achieve testability? That is, what have you done to make unit testing easier?
	 \end{note}

	\question{Alternatives}
	
	
	     \begin{note}
	     	Discuss two plausible alternative design choices, and explain their pros and cons.
	     \end{note}
\end{document}
